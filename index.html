            With endless possibilities, new opportunities and receiving
            conflicting advice, it can be hard for people to stay focused on
            their vision. Providing a safe learning environment is both a
            priority and a value.

              <p>
                The process of creating long-term goals and short-term
                objectives to support the mission is also essential for
                successful execution. Clearly articulating these goals helps
                ensure that the people and processes will be geared toward
                moving the organization in the right direction.

            We invested a lot of time as a full team contributing to discussions
